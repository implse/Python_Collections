__Counter__ : dict subclass for counting hashable objects.

__OrderedDict__ : dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added.


__defaultdict__ : dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values.

## Sorted collections

__queue__ : implement multi-producer, multi-consumer queues.
