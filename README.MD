# Python Collections

Collections is a built-in Python module that implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers such as dict, list, set, and tuple.

## High-Performance Container Collections

__deque__ : list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end.

__Counter__ : dict subclass for counting hashable objects.

__OrderedDict__ : dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added.

__defaultdict__ : dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values.

__namedtupple__ : tupple with named fields.

## Sorted Collections

__heapq__ : implementation of the heap queue algorithm.(Priority Queue algorithm)

__bisect__ : provides support for maintaining a list in sorted without having to sort the list after each insertion.(Array bisection algorithm)

__queue__ : implement multi-producer, multi-consumer queues.

## Basic Collections

__list__ : mutable sequence of values.

__tuple__ : fixed (immutable) sequence of values.

__set__ : sequence of distinct values.

__dictionary__ : collection of key-value pairs.
