# Python Collections

Collections is a built-in Python module that implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers such as `dict`, `list`, `set`, and `tuple`.

## High-Performance Container Collections

`deque` : list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end.

`Counter` : dict subclass for counting hashable objects.

`OrderedDict` : dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added.

`defaultdict` : dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values.

`namedtuple` : factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named field.

## Sorted Collections

`heapq` : implementation of the heap queue algorithm.(Priority Queue algorithm)

`bisect` : provides support for maintaining a list in sorted without having to sort the list after each insertion.(Array bisection algorithm)

`queue` : implement multi-producer, multi-consumer queues.

## Basic Collections

`list` : mutable sequence of values.

`tuple` : fixed (immutable) sequence of values.

`set` : sequence of distinct values.

`dictionary` : collection of key-value pairs.
